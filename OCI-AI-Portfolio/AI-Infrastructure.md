# GPU in AI Infrastructure

Graphics Processing Unit, or **GPU**, is a very important component of **AI infrastructure**. Let us see what a GPU is and why it is required.  

Machine learning and AI workloads need lots of **repetitive calculations** to be made on huge amounts of data — especially for **model training** and **inference**. A GPU is a piece of hardware that is incredibly good at certain types of calculations.

## Parallel Computing on GPU

Parallel computing on GPU is designed to run **many processes simultaneously**.  
GPU has **thousands of lightweight cores**, all working on their share of data in parallel.  

This gives them the ability to **process extremely large datasets at tremendous speed**.  
A GPU can process many inference tasks in parallel, leading to **significantly higher throughput** compared to a CPU.  

This is especially useful for:
- **Batch processing**
- **Serving multiple requests simultaneously**

## Modern GPUs and Deep Learning

Modern GPUs are optimized for deep learning frameworks like:
- **TensorFlow**
- **PyTorch**
- **ONNX Runtime**

These frameworks leverage **GPU-specific libraries** to accelerate computations.

## NVIDIA GPU Architectures

Let’s look at a few NVIDIA GPUs and their architectures:

| GPU Model | Year Introduced | Architecture | Key Features |
|------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **A100** | 2020 | Ampere | Introduced **Tensor Cores** that perform fused multiply-accumulate operations in a single clock cycle, accelerating deep learning workloads. |
| **H100** | 2022 | Hopper | Introduced a **dedicated transformer engine** to optimize performance of transformer models. |
| **H200** | 2024 | Hopper | Similar to H100 but with **more memory**. |
| **Blackwell (B200)** | 2025 | Blackwell | Designed to accelerate **large-scale AI models**, especially **LLMs (Large Language Models)**. |
| **GB200 Superchip** | 2025 | Grace + Blackwell | Combines two Grace CPUs with a Blackwell GPU for **unified AI compute performance**. |

## NVIDIA Grace CPU

The **NVIDIA Grace CPU** is a breakthrough processor designed for **modern data centers** running **AI Cloud** and **HPC (High-Performance Computing)** applications.

## OCI GPU Compute Lineup

To support a wide range of **small, medium, and large use cases**,  
**Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** is expanding its **GPU compute lineup**:

- **10,800 H100N** and **L40 GPU** are now generally available.  
- Orders are open for **H200**, **B200 GPUs**, and **GB200 superchips**, with general availability in **2025**.  
- **Superclusters** built using these GPUs are also available for order.  

---

## Performance Scaling

- Starting with **H200**, performance reaches **4× that of H100 superclusters**.  
- With **B200** and **GB200**, performance can reach **8× (APEX)** that of H100 for AI workloads.

## Using OCI AI Infrastructure with OCI Data Science

You can leverage **OCI AI Infrastructure** through **OCI Data Science** for both **training** and **deployment** of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**:

1. **Deploy Popular LLMs**
   - Directly to **VM** or **bare metal instances** powered by GPU.
   - Done easily via **OCI Data Science AI Quick Actions**.

2. **Fine-tune Base Models**
   - Customize and retrain models.
   - Deploy **custom inference models** using **OCI Data Science Add Quick Actions**.

3. **Supported Models**
   - You can register any model supported by:
     - **Virtual LLM**
     - **Next-generation inference**
     - **Text-embedding inference containers** in **AI Quick Actions**
