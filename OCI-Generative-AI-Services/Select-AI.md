## Introduction

Hi, welcome to this lesson on natural language queries in **Oracle Autonomous Database**.  
My name is **Michelle Malcher**, and I’m excited to show you how to use **Select AI** in Oracle Databases.  
We will look at using **natural language** to analyze your data.

Before we dive in, let's see where we are in the **Oracle AI landscape**.

## Oracle AI Landscape

We have been discussing **AI** and **large language models (LLMs)** in other lessons.  
Oracle provides AI to the enterprise at every layer.  

In this lesson, we’ll focus on **data** — how we can leverage the **Oracle Autonomous Database** with **large language models** to analyze and return results through SQL queries using natural language.

We’ll cover:
- What **Select AI** is in an Oracle Autonomous Database  
- How to query data using **natural language**  
- The **SQL query generation process flow**

---

## What Is Autonomous Database Select AI?

**Autonomous Database Select AI** makes it easy to get answers about your business using plain language.  
You don’t need to know:
- The structure of the data  
- How to write SQL queries  

Just ask your questions — the **Autonomous Database** manages the entire process, including:
1. Connecting to a large language model  
2. Engineering an optimized prompt for Oracle Database sources  
3. Delivering the result set, narrative, or SQL statement

---

## Building Applications with Select AI

You can build applications on **Autonomous Database** that use your data —  
remember, language models don’t know your internal organizational data.  
They’re trained on **public data**.

Using **natural language** and **AI**, you can:
- Query and summarize your data  
- Generate insightful responses  
- Build innovative, AI-powered solutions  

---

## Demo: APEX App with Select AI

Here’s a simple demo app built with **Autonomous Database** using **APEX**.

### Example Queries
- “Show the top 10 streamed movies.”  
- “List the actors in those movies.”  
- “Get the total number of movies streamed.”

These natural language queries generate and execute the necessary SQL automatically.

The **APEX interactive report** allows you to:
- Filter and explore results  
- View charts and alternative formats  
- Interact with your data visually  

You didn’t even need to know the **table names** or **columns**!

---

## Viewing Generated SQL

You can view the generated SQL using:

```sql
SELECT AI SHOWSQL;
```

This displays:
- The SQL query
- The tables and joins used
- The result set returned

---

## Select AI on the Move

When using Select AI in APEX apps or other interfaces, it:
1. Takes your natural language question
2. Translates it into SQL
3. Runs the query using LLMs
4. Returns accurate results
Large language models differ in quality — some are better at writing SQL and inferring intent.
You can review, verify, and refine your queries as needed.

---

## Developing Apps with Select AI
Developing apps with Select AI is simple and future-ready:
- Integrate generative AI capabilities into existing applications
- Build new AI-driven solutions
- Choose the best LLM for your business needs
- Support fine-tuned models

---

## Security and Privacy

Using Oracle Database, your data is protected at every layer.
With Autonomous Select AI and OCI Generative AI:
- Your data stays within your tenancy
- It is not sent to external LLM providers
- It is not visible to other customers

---

## Under the Covers: How It Works

When querying the database using a tool like SQL Developer,
you can use a syntax such as:
```sql
SELECT AI 'Find the top 10 streamed movies';
```

Instead of using the traditional FROM and WHERE clauses,
the system processes the SELECT AI statement just like any SQL query.

You can also use:
```sql
SELECT AI SHOWSQL;
```
to display the SQL generated by the model.
You can refine your questions further to explore your data more deeply.

---

## AI Profiles and Model Selection

One of the key design principles for Select AI is pluggability, implemented through AI profiles.
You can choose from:
1. OCI Generative AI
2. Cohere
3. OpenAI
4. Llama, and more

Then, define which:
- Schemas
- Tables
- Views

will participate in the process.

Use the DBMS_CLOUD_AI PL/SQL package to configure AI profiles directly within the database.

---

## Wrapping Up

To generate a SQL query, you can simply ask your database using Select AI, for example:

> “Find the top customer segments for George Clooney movies.”

The AI profile uses the large language model defined in your database metadata to:
1. Interpret the question
2. Generate the SQL
3. Return the results or SQL statement to your tool (e.g., SQL Developer) or application

---

## Conclusion
We’ve shown how easy it is to:
- Build AI-powered apps
- Use Oracle Autonomous Database with Select AI
- Get insights securely using large language models
Your data remains secure and your applications stay future-enabled — ready to integrate new or fine-tuned AI models that best fit your business needs.
