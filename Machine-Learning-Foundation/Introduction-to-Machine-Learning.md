# Module: Machine Learning Foundations

## 🤖 What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning (ML) is a **subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on creating computer systems that can **learn and predict outcomes** from given examples **without being explicitly programmed**.  

- Powered by **algorithms**  
- Learns automatically from **data (examples)**  
- Incorporates **intelligence into machines**

## 📌 Everyday Examples of Machine Learning
ML is used by all of us in daily life:  

- **Online Shopping** → product recommendations based on preferences & shopping history  
- **Streaming Services (Netflix)** → movie recommendations based on viewing history & similar viewers  
- **Email Filtering** → spam detection based on content  
- **Self-Driving Cars** → navigating safely to destination

## ⚙️ How Machine Learning Works
### Example: Cat vs Dog Classification
1. **Input Data (Features):**  
   - Body color, texture, eye color, etc.  
2. **Labels (Output):**  
   - “Cat” or “Dog”  
3. **Training Dataset:**  
   - A set of features + labels used to train the model  
4. **Training Phase:**  
   - The ML model learns the relationship between features and labels  
5. **Inference Phase:**  
   - A new data point is given (features of animal)  
   - The trained model predicts → Cat or Dog

## 🧩 Types of Machine Learning
The type of ML model depends on whether **labeled output** is available.

1. **Supervised Learning**  
   - Uses labeled data  
   - Learns relation between features and labels  

2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   - Uses unlabeled data  
   - Finds hidden relationships & structures in data  

3. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   - Learns from **feedback** (rewards & punishments)  
   - Makes decisions through trial and error

## 🌍 Real-World Applications
### ✅ Supervised Learning
- Disease detection  
- Weather forecasting  
- Stock price prediction  
- Spam detection  
- Credit scoring  

*Example*: Patient data → ML model predicts whether the patient has a disease.  

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning
- Fraudulent transaction detection  
- Customer segmentation  
- Outlier detection  
- Targeted marketing campaigns  

*Example*: Transaction data → ML model identifies patterns leading to fraud.  

### 🤖 Reinforcement Learning
- Automated robots  
- Autonomous driving cars  
- Playing strategy games

## 📚 Summary
- **ML** = Subset of AI, learns from data without explicit programming  
- Works via **training** (learning from examples) → **inference** (making predictions)  
- **Three main types**: Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement  
- Applications: Healthcare, finance, marketing, automation, robotics
