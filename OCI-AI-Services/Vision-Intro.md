## ⚡ Main Capabilities

OCI Vision provides **two primary capabilities**:

### 1. 🧩 Image Analysis
Image analysis allows you to extract detailed information from **photographic images**.  
It includes powerful features such as:

#### 🔍 Object Detection
- Detects multiple objects within an image.  
- Draws **bounding boxes** around detected items.  
- Assigns **labels** (like “car,” “tree,” or “person”) to each object.  
- Displays an **accuracy percentage** to indicate confidence.  
- Locates and extracts **text** found in scenes (e.g., signs, documents, or labels).

#### 🏷️ Image Classification
- Assigns **classification labels** to entire images.  
- Identifies major features or themes in a scene.  
- Useful for categorizing large volumes of visual data, such as sorting product photos, detecting defects, or identifying landmarks.

### 2. 📄 Document AI
The **Document AI** feature focuses on **analyzing text-rich documents** such as invoices, forms, and receipts.  
It can:
- Detect printed or handwritten text  
- Extract key fields and structured data  
- Enable automated document workflows

---

## 🔁 Customization and Model Training

One of the most powerful capabilities of OCI Vision is **model retraining**.

- Users can **retrain models** with their own labeled datasets.  
- This allows the model to adapt to **specific use cases** — for example, recognizing proprietary product parts, logos, or document types.  
- Retraining enhances accuracy and ensures the model performs optimally within your organization’s data context.
