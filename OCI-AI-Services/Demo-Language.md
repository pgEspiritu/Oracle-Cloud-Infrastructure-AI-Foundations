### 🗂️ Text Classification
- **Category:** *Science and Technology*

### 🏷️ Named Entity Recognition
The service highlights **named entities** directly in the text, with color-coded tags showing:

- 🔢 **Quantity**

Each entity is accompanied by:
- The **entity type**

### 🧩 Key Phrase Extraction
OCI Language lists all key phrases identified within the text — these are the **main ideas** or **important terms** that summarize its content.

---

### 💬 Sentiment Analysis
The analysis provides **three types of sentiment results**:

| Sentiment Type | Description | Example Output |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| 📄 **Document-level** | Overall tone of the entire text | Mixed |
| 🎯 **Aspect-based** | Sentiment per identified topic/aspect | Negative |

This gives a granular view of how different parts of the text express emotions or opinions.
