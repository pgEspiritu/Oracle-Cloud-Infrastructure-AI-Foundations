# 🤖 Lesson: AI Tasks & Data Across Domains

## 📝 Language AI

### 📌 Types of Tasks
1. **Text-related tasks (NLP)** → Input is text, output varies.  
   Examples:  
   - Language detection  
   - Extracting entities  
   - Extracting key phrases  
   - Text translation  

   Example:  
   - Paste text into a translation tool → choose source & target → click **Translate**.

2. **Generative AI tasks** → Output text is **generated by the model**.  
   Examples:  
   - Story or poem creation  
   - Text summarization  
   - Question answering  
   - Chatbots like **ChatGPT**, powered by large language models (LLMs)

### 🔡 Text as Data
- Text is **sequential** → sentences → words → tokens  
- **Tokenization** → words → numbers for model training  
- **Padding** → ensures sentences are of equal length  
- **Similarity measures** → dot product, cosine similarity  
- **Embeddings** → represent similar words/sentences as vectors close in space  

---

### 🧠 Model Architectures for Language
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)** → sequential processing, hidden states  
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** → sequential + context retention via gates  
- **Transformers** → parallel processing, self-attention mechanism

## 🔊 Audio & Speech AI

### 📌 Types of Tasks
1. **Audio-related tasks** → Input audio/speech, output varies.  
   Examples:  
   - Speech-to-text  
   - Speaker recognition  
   - Voice conversion  

2. **Generative AI tasks** → Output audio generated by model.  
   Examples:  
   - Music composition  
   - Speech synthesis (Text-to-Speech)  

---

### 🎼 Audio as Data
- **Sampling rate** → snapshots per second (e.g., **44.1 kHz** for CDs → 44,100 samples/s)  
- **Bit depth** → information richness of each sample  
- A single sample ≠ meaningful → must analyze **multiple correlated samples**  
- Example: A fraction of a second of music ≠ identifiable song  

---

### 🧠 Model Architectures for Audio
- **RNN / LSTM / Transformers** → sequential audio modeling  
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** → generative sound modeling  
- **Waveform models** → raw waveform processing  
- **Siamese networks** → speaker verification & similarity tasks

## 👀 Vision AI

### 📌 Types of Tasks
1. **Image-related tasks** → Input is image, output depends on task.  
   Examples:  
   - Image classification  
   - Object detection  
   - Facial recognition (security, biometrics, social media, law enforcement)  

2. **Generative AI tasks** → Output is new/generated image.  
   Examples:  
   - Create images from text prompts  
   - Style transfer (specific artistic look)  
   - Super-resolution  
   - 3D model generation (objects, buildings, people, medication, etc.)  

---

### 🖼️ Images as Data
- Images = **pixels** (grayscale or color)  
- A single pixel ≠ meaningful → patterns emerge across many pixels  
- **Input/output vary** depending on the vision task  

---

### 🧠 Model Architectures for Vision
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)** → detect hierarchical patterns/features  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** → real-time object detection  
- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** → generate realistic images/videos  

---

## 🔍 Other AI Tasks

- **📊 Anomaly Detection** → Time-series data for fraud detection, machine failure, etc.  
- **🛍️ Recommendations** → Product or user-based recommendations using similarity data  
- **🌦️ Forecasting** → Time-series forecasting for weather, stock prices, etc.  

---

## ✅ Summary
- **Language AI** → NLP & generative text tasks, embeddings, transformers.  
- **Audio/Speech AI** → Speech-to-text, synthesis, sequential signal modeling.  
- **Vision AI** → Classification, detection, image generation using CNNs, YOLO, GANs.  
- **Other tasks** → Anomaly detection, recommendations, forecasting.  

AI domains differ by **type of data (text, audio, images)** and **model architectures**, but all share the goal of **replicating and enhancing human capabilities**.
