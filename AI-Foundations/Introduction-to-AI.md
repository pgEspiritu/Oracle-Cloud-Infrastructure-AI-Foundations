## 👤 Human Intelligence Capabilities
Humans can:
- 📚 Learn new skills through observation and practice  
- 💡 Understand abstract concepts and apply reasoning  
- 🗣️ Communicate using language and interpret non-verbal cues (facial recognition, tone, body language)  
- 🎯 Handle objections in real-time, even in complex scenarios  
- 📅 Plan for short-term and long-term goals/projects  
- 🎨 Create music, art, and invent original ideas

## 🧩 Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) vs AI
- **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)** → Machines that can mimic **human-level intelligence**, sensory/motor skills, and learning to perform complex tasks without human input.  
- **AI (Applied/Specific Intelligence)** → When AGI is applied to solve **narrow, well-defined objectives**.

## 🌍 Examples of AI in Daily Life
- 🖼️ Image classification → Identify an apple vs an orange  
- 📧 Email filtering → Spam vs not spam  
- 💻 Code generation → Writing programming code  
- 🚗 Prediction → Estimating the price of an older car
