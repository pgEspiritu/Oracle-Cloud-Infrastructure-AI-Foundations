# Lesson: Customizing LLMs with Your Own Data

## The Customization Framework

We’ll consider two main axes of customization:

- **Horizontal Axis – Context Optimization:**  
  Providing more specific, detailed, or up-to-date information for the LLM to draw from.  
  Example: user-specific data such as recent orders from a website.

- **Vertical Axis – LLM Optimization:**  
  Adapting or training the LLM to perform specific tasks or specialize in a domain.  
  Example: fine-tuning a model for legal or medical use cases.

### The Three Methods

1. **Prompt Engineering** – The fastest, simplest, and most iterative approach.  
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Adds external context to improve grounding.  
3. **Fine-Tuning** – Adapts the model itself to your domain and style.  

These methods are **additive** — in real-world systems, you might use all three together.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### What Is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enables an LLM to query external knowledge bases (e.g., vector databases, wikis, document repositories) to generate **grounded** responses — meaning, the generated text is *supported by actual data sources*.

### Example

Imagine a chatbot interacting with a user:

- **User:** “I’d like to return a dress I just bought.”  
- **Chatbot:** “Sure! Let me check the return policy.”  
- The chatbot queries an **enterprise database**, retrieves the policy (e.g., *returns accepted within 30–90 days, sale items not eligible*), and responds accordingly.
- If the user uploads a receipt, the chatbot extracts information (like price and date) using **vision AI**, checks it against the policy, and confirms eligibility.

This is an example of a **RAG implementation** — the chatbot provides *accurate, grounded* answers using up-to-date, private knowledge.

### RAG Components

1. **Retrieval:**  
   Search over a corpus or database to find relevant information.  
2. **Augmented Generation:**  
   Incorporate that retrieved information into a natural language response.

### Key Benefits

- No fine-tuning required.  
- Provides LLMs access to **private and dynamic knowledge**.  
- Greatly improves **accuracy and relevance**.

## Fine-Tuning and Inference

### What Is Fine-Tuning?

**Fine-tuning** involves taking a pre-trained foundational model and *training it further* on your **custom domain-specific data**.  
This helps the model better perform specialized tasks or adopt a desired style or tone.

### Process Overview

1. **Pre-trained Model:** Start with a general-purpose model.  
2. **Custom Dataset:** Prepare labeled, domain-specific data.  
3. **Fine-Tuning:** Train (partially or fully) on this data.  
4. **Inference:** The fine-tuned model generates new outputs based on both its pre-training and your fine-tuned knowledge.

### Why Fine-Tune?

You should fine-tune when:
- The pre-trained model doesn’t perform your task well.  
- You want it to learn **new skills or terminology**.  
- You want it to adopt a **specific tone or writing style**.

### Example

- Start with a general LLM.  
- Fine-tune it with legal contracts → It becomes a **legal assistant model**.  
- Fine-tune it with customer support transcripts → It becomes a **support chatbot model**.

### Advanced Approach: T-Few Fine-Tuning (OCI Example)

In **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**, a method called **T-Few Fine-Tuning** is used.  
It inserts new layers and updates only a small subset of weights, drastically reducing both **training cost** and **time** while maintaining performance.

### Benefits of Fine-Tuning

1. **Improved Performance:**  
   Better contextual understanding and domain relevance.  
2. **Improved Efficiency:**  
   Reduced token usage and a smaller, faster model.

### Limitations

- Requires labeled data, which can be **expensive and time-consuming** to collect.  
- Requires **computational resources** for training.

## When to Use Each Method

Here’s a simple decision framework to help you choose:

| Method | When to Use | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Prompt Engineering** | When the base model already understands your domain | No training cost, quick iteration | Limited control, less reliable for complex tasks |
| **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | When you need to access or ground outputs in private or changing data | Reduces hallucinations, uses latest data | Needs a good data source, more complex setup |
| **Fine-Tuning** | When your model performs poorly on domain-specific tasks | Higher accuracy and efficiency | Needs labeled data and compute resources |

## Putting It All Together: A Practical Workflow

Here’s how a typical LLM customization journey might look:

1. **Start with Prompt Engineering**  
   - Create and evaluate your baseline prompt.  
   - Add few-shot examples (input/output pairs).  
   - If results are good → stop here.

2. **Add RAG for Context**  
   - Connect the model to enterprise or private data sources.  
   - Evaluate performance improvements.  
   - If it meets your needs → stop here.

3. **Fine-Tune for Specialized Behavior**  
   - If the model output still isn’t in the desired format, tone, or accuracy, fine-tune it.  
   - Optimize your RAG setup if retrieval quality is low.  
   - Continue iterating between RAG and fine-tuning as needed.

This iterative process often leads to a combination of **prompt engineering + RAG + fine-tuning** — the most powerful setup for customized LLMs.

## Summary

In this lesson, we explored how to customize LLMs using three complementary methods:

1. **Prompt Engineering** – Simple, fast iteration using prompts.  
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – Grounded responses with private data.  
3. **Fine-Tuning** – Domain adaptation and improved efficiency.
