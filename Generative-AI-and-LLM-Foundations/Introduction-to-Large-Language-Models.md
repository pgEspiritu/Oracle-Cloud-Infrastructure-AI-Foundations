# Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

## What is a Language Model?

A **language model** is a **probabilistic model of text** that determines the likelihood of a given sequence of words occurring in a sentence, based on the previous words.  
It helps predict which word is **most likely to appear next**.

### Example
Consider the sentence:

> “I wrote to the zoo to send me a pet. They sent me — ___.”

A language model:
- Computes a **probability distribution** over its **vocabulary** (the set of all possible words).
- Assigns probabilities to words like “lion,” “elephant,” “dog,” “cat,” etc.
- For instance:
  - `P(lion) = 0.03`
  - `P(elephant) = 0.02`
  - `P(dog) = 0.45`
  - and so on.

Only words relevant to the context (e.g., animals) are included — not unrelated words like “car” or “building.”

## What Does “Large” Mean in LLMs?

When we say **Large Language Model**, the term *large* refers to the **number of parameters** in the model.  
While there’s no exact threshold defining when a model becomes “large,” modern LLMs often contain **hundreds of millions to hundreds of billions of parameters**.

## How Does a Language Model Generate Text?

To select the next word, the model picks the **word with the highest probability**.

### Example Walkthrough

1. The model predicts probabilities for each word in the vocabulary.
2. It selects the most probable word — for example, **“dog”**.
3. The model appends “dog” to the sentence and reprocesses it.
4. Probabilities for subsequent words adjust accordingly.
5. Eventually, the model predicts an **end-of-sentence (EOS)** token.

Final output:

> “I wrote to the zoo to send me a pet. They sent me a dog.”

This iterative process continues until the EOS token is generated.

## What Can You Do with Large Language Models?

LLMs are powerful and versatile. They can:

- **Answer questions**  
  *Example:* “What is the capital of France?” → “Paris”

- **Reason and solve problems**  
  LLMs can explain logical steps before giving the answer.

- **Generate content**  
  Write essays, articles, poems, or reports.

- **Translate text**  
  *Example:* “Translate ‘How are you?’ into French” → “Comment allez-vous ?”

These are just a few examples — LLMs are foundational to modern AI systems.

## Architecture Behind LLMs: The Transformer

LLMs are built on a **deep learning architecture** called the **Transformer**.

Transformers enable models to:
- Pay **selective attention** to different parts of the input.
- Capture **contextual relationships** between words.
- Handle **long sequences** effectively.

This gives LLMs strong **contextual understanding** and allows them to excel in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks such as:
- Question answering  
- Language translation  
- Sentiment analysis  
- Text summarization

## LLMs and Deep Learning

LLMs are **deep neural networks** trained on **massive amounts of text data** — often covering large portions of publicly available internet text.

- Each model parameter is an **adjustable weight** in the network.
- These weights are optimized during training to **predict the next word**.
- The **model size** refers to the memory required to store these parameters.

Over time, models have grown exponentially in parameter count:
- From hundreds of millions  
- To tens or hundreds of billions  
- Some even beyond **540 billion parameters**

> ⚠️ Note: A larger model doesn’t always mean better performance.  
> Excessively large models can **overfit** the training data.

## Summary

- **Language Model** → Predicts the next word based on prior context.  
- **LLM (Large Language Model)** → A large-scale neural network trained on vast text datasets.  
- **Built on Transformer Architecture** → Enables contextual understanding and efficient sequence processing.  
- **Applications** → Question answering, summarization, translation, content generation, and more.  
- **Parameters** → Represent learned knowledge; more parameters = larger model.
