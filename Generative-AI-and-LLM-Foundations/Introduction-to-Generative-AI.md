# Introduction to Generative AI


## What is AI?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the ability of machines to imitate human intelligence.  
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI where algorithms learn from past data to predict outcomes on new data or identify trends.

**Deep Learning (DL)** is a further subset of machine learning in which algorithms are modeled using neural networks to learn from complex data.

In this module, we will look at **Generative AI (GenAI)** in more detail.

## What is Generative AI?

As the name suggests, **Generative AI** is a type of AI that can **create new content**.  
GenAI models can produce a wide range of outputs such as **text**, **images**, **music**, **videos**, and **other media**.

Generative AI is a subset of **deep learning**, where models are trained to **generate outputs autonomously**.  
It unlocks exciting possibilities for **creative tasks**, **automation**, and **innovation**.

## How Does Generative AI Work?

At a high level, a **generative AI model** learns the underlying patterns in a dataset and uses that knowledge to create **new data** that shares those patterns.

### Example: Teaching a Model to Draw a Dog
1. You provide many pictures of dogs for the model to learn from.  
2. The GenAI model observes patterns such as ears, teeth, and whiskers.  
3. After training, the model can generate **a new picture of a dog** — not copied, but created based on learned patterns.

This process involves **complex mathematics** and **computation**, using various architectures and techniques — but the idea remains the same.

## Comparison: Generative AI vs. Machine Learning

### Machine Learning
Machine Learning focuses on identifying patterns and classifying new data.

- Models are trained with **labeled datasets** (input features and output labels).
- Example: A picture of a cat labeled as “cat”, a dog labeled as “dog”.
- The model learns the relationship between features and labels.
- After training, the model performs **inference** — predicting labels for new data.

This type of learning is called **Supervised Machine Learning**.

### Generative AI
- Learns **patterns in unstructured content**.
- Does **not require labeled data** during pre-training.
- Can generate **new outputs** — such as text, images, or videos.
- Focuses on **generation**, not just prediction or classification.

Later, GenAI models can be **fine-tuned** with labeled data for specific tasks.

## Types of Generative AI Models

### 1. Text-Based Models
These models generate:
- Text
- Code
- Dialogues or chat
- Articles

They learn from **large text corpora**, capturing **language patterns**, **structures**, and **semantic relationships**.

### 2. Multimodal Models
These models process and generate **multiple types of data** simultaneously:
- Text  
- Images  
- Audio  
- Video  

They can understand relationships across different modalities.

## Applications of Generative AI

Generative AI impacts nearly every industry and use case:

- **Content creation** (text, music, images, and videos)
- **Image and video generation**
- **Automation of creative workflows**
- **Medical imaging and drug discovery**
  - Accelerates **scientific progress**
  - Aids in **drug development** and **diagnosis**

Generative AI is transforming both **creative industries** and **scientific research**.

## Summary

- **AI** → enables machines to imitate human intelligence  
- **Machine Learning** → learns from labeled data to predict or classify  
- **Deep Learning** → handles complex data with neural networks  
- **Generative AI** → learns from patterns to create new, original content  

Generative AI differs from traditional AI by focusing on **generation**, not just **prediction**.
